# d3-dashboard
A d3 dashboard showing CO2 emissions by various countries between 1990-2011.

This dashboard was implemented using `d3js` and uses `topojson` for the map visualization. `Bulma` css is used for styling. Transitions in the visulization are smooth thanks to `d3-transition` and `d3-ease`.

## Data
The data for the visualization can be obtained [here](http://data.un.org/)

## Live Demo
The live demo can be found here:
